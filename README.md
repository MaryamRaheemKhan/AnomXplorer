# Project Title
**AnomXplorer- Anomaly Detector System for HealthCare System**
Log Based Testing Through Machine Learning for Hospital Management Systems

## Section Title
**Description To Project**
Our project explores machine learning for log-based testing in hospital systems to enhance data integrity and security by detecting
anomalies in system logs. We propose an advanced anomaly detection system using a decision tree algorithm for real-time analysis
applied in a Jupyter Notebook for real-time analysis. The system includes a React.js frontend, Node.js backend (Express), and
MongoDB, offering administrators an intuitive interface for managing hospital data. Preprocessing ensures data readiness, with
dynamic anomaly displays and a dashboard showing frequency and patient statistics. Expected outcomes include improved data
monitoring and security in hospitals.

## Features
The project includes:
● User authentication and authorization
● Real-time anomaly detection
● Data Visualization/Analysis
● Notification System for critical anomalies

## Project Objectives
The objectives include:
● Enhancing security.
● Improving anomaly detection accuracy by using ML algorithm.
● Providing real-time data visualization.
