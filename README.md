# Project Title
**AnomXplorer- Anomaly Detector System for HealthCare System**

Log Based Testing Through Machine Learning for Hospital Management Systems

## Section Title
**Description To Project**

Our project explores machine learning for log-based testing in hospital systems to enhance data integrity and security by detecting
anomalies in system logs. We propose an advanced anomaly detection system using a decision tree algorithm for real-time analysis
applied in a Jupyter Notebook for real-time analysis. The system includes a React.js frontend, Node.js backend (Express), and
MongoDB, offering administrators an intuitive interface for managing hospital data. Preprocessing ensures data readiness, with
dynamic anomaly displays and a dashboard showing frequency and patient statistics. Expected outcomes include improved data
monitoring and security in hospitals.

## Features
The project includes:

- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Data Visualization/Analysis
- Notification System for critical anomalies

## Project Objectives
The objectives include:
- Enhancing security.
- Improving anomaly detection accuracy by using ML algorithm.
- Providing real-time data visualization.

## What problem it addresses
The need for an anomaly detection system tailored for hospital systems
stems from several critical factors:

- *Manual Testing*: Hospitals are testing their system manually or
automated but still require resources and a lot of time so our project
aims to detect anomalies using machine learning algorithms to be
more effective and fast.
- *Patient Safety and Care Quality*: Anomalies within hospital systems
have potential to threaten patient safety and care quality. Detecting
and addressing these anomalies in a timely manner is paramount to
ensuring optimal patient outcomes.
- *Operational Efficiency*: By identifying and addressing these
anomalies, hospitals can streamline operations and optimize resource
allocation.

## What problem it addresses
The proposed AnomXplorer offers several benefits to healthcare
organizations and stakeholders:

- Prevention of Extra charges and Unauthorized fees: Hospital bills
often include various charges and fees for services. However,
anomalies such as unauthorized fees or excessive charges can result
in financial burdens for patients and undermine trust in healthcare
institutions.
- Early Anomaly Detection: By leveraging ML algorithms, the system
can detect anomalies in hospital systems data in real-time, enabling
early intervention of potential risks.
- Data-driven insights: By providing actionable insights into the
performance and integrity of hospital systems, the healthcare
administrators can make informed decisions and implement targeted
interventions to improve system reliability and performance

## API Reference

| Endpoint          | Method | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/users`      | GET    | Get all users from the database                    |
| `/api/signup`     | POST   | Register a new user by saving user info in the DB  |
| `/api/login`      | POST   | Log in an existing user by validating credentials  |
| `/api/predictions`| GET    | Get all predictions from the database              |
| `/api/Email`      | POST   | Send an email for anomaly detection with a message |


### Sample Request for `/api/signup`

To register a new user, you can use the following sample request:

**Method**: `POST`  
**URL**: `http://localhost:5000/api/signup`

**Headers**:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
**Body**:
```json
{
  "username": "newUser",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

**Curl Command**

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/signup 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "newUser", "password": "securePassword123"}'
